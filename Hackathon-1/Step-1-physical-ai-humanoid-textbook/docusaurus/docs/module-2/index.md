# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Simulation Environment)

## Overview

Module 2 introduces the concept of the "Digital Twin" in robotics, focusing on creating accurate simulation environments for humanoid robots. This module covers the fundamentals of simulation environments, physics simulation, sensor simulation, and visualization techniques that enable effective human-robot interaction.

The digital twin approach allows us to create a virtual replica of a physical system that can mirror real-world scenarios with high fidelity. This is essential for developing, testing, and validating humanoid robots in a safe and cost-effective manner before deploying on physical hardware.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:

1. Understand the role of simulation in robotics development
2. Set up and configure simulation environments (Isaac Sim and Gazebo)
3. Configure physics parameters for realistic humanoid simulation
4. Implement and validate sensor simulation for various sensor types
5. Design effective visualization approaches for human-robot interaction
6. Evaluate the impact of simulation parameters on real-world transfer

## Module Structure

This module is organized into four chapters, each building upon the previous to provide a comprehensive understanding of creating and utilizing digital twins for humanoid robotics:
