# Academic Citation Tracking System

## Purpose
This document outlines the citation tracking system for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook modules. All claims must be supported by authoritative sources following APA 7th edition format, with at least 50% of sources being peer-reviewed or official technical documentation.

## Citation Categories

### Required Source Types (Minimum 50%)
- Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Conference proceedings
- Official technical documentation (ROS, NVIDIA, OpenAI, etc.)
- Academic books

### Acceptable Additional Sources
- Preprint repositories (arXiv, bioRxiv)
- Industry white papers
- Technical blogs from recognized experts
- Documentation from reputable organizations
