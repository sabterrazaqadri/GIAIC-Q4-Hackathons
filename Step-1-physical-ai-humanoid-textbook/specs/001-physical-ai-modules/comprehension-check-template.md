# Comprehension Check Template

## Format

Each comprehension check should follow this structure:

### Question Format
```
**Question Title:** [Clear, specific question]

[Detailed question text]

- A) [Plausible but incorrect answer]
- B) [Plausible but incorrect answer]
- C) [Correct answer]
- D) [Plausible but incorrect answer]

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** [Detailed explanation of why C is correct and why other options are incorrect]
**Difficulty:** [Basic/Intermediate/Advanced]
```

## Guidelines

1. **Clarity**: Questions should be clear and unambiguous
2. **Relevance**: Questions should test understanding of key concepts from the chapter
3. **Distractors**: Wrong answers should be plausible to test true understanding
4. **Explanation**: Provide detailed explanation of the correct answer and why other options are wrong
5. **Difficulty**: Match the difficulty level to the chapter content and target audience
6. **Cognitive Levels**: Include questions at different cognitive levels (remember, understand, apply)

## Question Types

### Conceptual Questions
- Test understanding of key concepts and principles
- Example: "Which of the following best describes the primary advantage of Isaac Sim over basic Gazebo simulation?"

### Application Questions
- Test ability to apply concepts in new situations
- Example: "If you wanted to simulate a humanoid robot with 20 degrees of freedom, which physics parameters would be most critical to adjust?"

### Analysis Questions
- Test ability to break down complex concepts
- Example: "Compare the trade-offs between sensor simulation fidelity and performance in robotics simulation."

## Best Practices

1. Avoid double negatives or complex sentence structures
2. Make sure questions are independent of each other
3. Include visual elements where helpful (with proper alt-text)
4. Ensure questions align with the learning objectives
5. Include sources for complex questions requiring specific technical knowledge
