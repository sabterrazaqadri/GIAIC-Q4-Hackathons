# Learning Objectives Template

## Structure

Each chapter should have 3-5 specific, measurable learning objectives that follow the format:

- "After completing this chapter, you should be able to [VERB] [OBJECT/SKILL] [CONTEXT/CRITERIA]"

## Examples of Strong Objectives

- "After completing this chapter, you should be able to configure a basic simulation environment in Isaac Sim with 90% accuracy"
- "After completing this chapter, you should be able to implement a simple perception pipeline with ROS 2 nodes"
- "After completing this chapter, you should be able to design safety validation layers for robot actions"

## Verbs for Different Cognitive Levels

### Remember
- Define, describe, identify, label, list, match, name, recall, recognize

### Understand
- Classify, convert, defend, explain, extend, interpret, outline, predict, recognize

### Apply
- Apply, calculate, change, demonstrate, illustrate, manipulate, modify, operate

### Analyze
- Analyze, categorize, compare, connect, contrast, differentiate, distinguish

### Evaluate
- Appraise, critique, evaluate, justify, support, validate, verify

### Create
- Compose, construct, develop, design, generate, integrate, plan, produce

## Guidelines

1. Each objective should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)
2. Use action verbs that align with the cognitive level required for the skill
3. Objectives should be assessable through comprehension checks or lab exercises
4. Limit to 3-5 objectives per chapter for clarity and focus
